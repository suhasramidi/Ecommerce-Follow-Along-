# MERN E-commerce Application - Milestone 1: Project Overview

## Project Description

This project involves building a full-stack e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application will allow users to browse products, register/login, add items to a cart, and place orders. This milestone focuses on understanding the project's overall structure, goals, and setting up the project repository.

## Key Features

* **MERN Stack:** Utilizes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for a full-stack JavaScript development experience.
* **REST API Creation:** Develops scalable APIs for handling data and logic.
* **Authentication:** Implements secure user authentication (login and registration).
* **Database Schema Design:** Designs structured data models in MongoDB.
* **Backend Development:** Sets up a robust server-side using Node.js and Express.
* **React Frontend:** Builds a dynamic and responsive user interface using React.

## Functionalities of the E-commerce Application

* **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts and securely log in.
* **Product Management:** Administrators can add, update, and remove products. Users can browse available products.
* **Order Handling:** Users can add products to a cart and place orders.
* **Database Interaction:** All data is stored and retrieved from a MongoDB database.
* **API Endpoints:** RESTful API endpoints facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

## Milestone 1 Summary

In this milestone, we focused on:

* Understanding the overall architecture of a MERN stack application.
* Gaining clarity on the functionalities of the e-commerce application.
* Learning about REST API structure and endpoints.
* Understanding the basics of database schema design in MongoDB.
* Understanding the importance of user authentication.
* Setting up the project repository on GitHub.

## Milestone 2 Summary
